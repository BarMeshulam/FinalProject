This is the final project of WEB systems development course
This final project is about a sneaker store that allows its customers to make purchases on the website.

On our website there are two types of users: customer and manager.


The home page of our website look like this:

An manager or customer existing in the system can log in through the log-in page:

The person entering the site for the first time has the option to register as a customer.
The customer registration page looks like this:

After a customer has registered, he can view the product catalog which is divided into categories and add products to his shopping cart

After a manager has logged in, this is the home page that he see:

As you can see, the manager navigation bar is different and offers him many options such as adding shoes to the catalog, adding a new user and determining his type or deleting an existing user, viewing the open orders and closing the relevant order when it is completed.
And of course he has the option to logged out from the website.
